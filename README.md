# OpenCV C++ Tutorials

I'll try to make some content for videos about OpenCV with C++ in the style of TheCherno C++ videos.  
For now I will use OpenCV 4.1.1 and Qt Creator 5.

Download OpenCV 4.1.1 from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/4.1.1.zip

Make sure you have Docker installed.

then

`chmod +x run.sh exec.sh`

and

`docker build -t opencv_1 .`

finally

`./run.sh`

If you want to open a new terminal to interact with the container

`./exec.sh`
